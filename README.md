# Project-Euler-Solutions 

*N.B. Spoilers (obviously)! Please [have a go at the challenges yourself](https://projecteuler.net) before viewing my solutions - they're great fun.*

> My solutions for Project Euler challenges, written C++

Although Python is my main programming language, C++ is commonly used for algorithmic/competitive programming, as it is a faster and more efficient language. Therefore, I decided to learn C++ and practise by working through Project Euler challenges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

For some of the later problems, I've included a (header file)[../useful.h] that I made, containing several useful functions, with code accumulated from previous problems.
